ONT HG820 user: root, pass: admin
ONT HG8240 user: telecomadmin, pass: admintelecom
ONT HG8240H user: telecomadmin, pass: admintelecom

On both cases, you must unplug fiber to allow access via ETH port, using 192.168.100.1 (ONT) and 192.168.100.2 (workstation)

For the ASKEY router access to ONT config, you have to go to 

http://192.168.1.1/instalacion 

and use the same user/pass than for the Router configuration. The IDONT/GPON params are the same than
for the Huawei ONT. 

Also, if you have VoIP service contracted, you must change the Serial Number (S/N) for the ONT as well as the IDONT password. 
Leaving the S/N provided by default will not work (for the VoIP configuration).
